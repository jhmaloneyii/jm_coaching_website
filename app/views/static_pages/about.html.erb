        <h2>Meet Joe Maloney</h2>
          <p><pre>&#9;</pre> Hello, my name is Joseph Maloney. I have been riding for most of my life and racing since I was in highschool. I started riding with my dad, going on road, gravel path, and mountain bike rides. I high school I started racing the Wisconsin Off-Road Series more seriously and in college I transitioned to a fully committed cyclist alongside my studies. I rode for a couple smaller teams before getting a spot on Team Wisconsin where I was able to really grow as a cyclist, traveling to many regional and national events as well as progressing through the ranks of the vibrant local scene. Around this time I also started working with Coach Gordy and began a more structured training program. <br><br><pre>&#9;</pre>I always had dreams of racing at the top level of the American off-road racing, and with the help of my team and coach I was able to make that happen by traveling to everything from national level cyclocross races, to national level mountain bike races, as well as a World Cup mountain bike race in Quebec, Canada and a UCI in China. As I developed as a racer, and progressed through my studies, I began to think about what was next and not wanting to slow down as a racer I decided that I could become a coach to support my racing and help others reach their potential at the same time. Over the years I’ve found great fulfillment from guiding others towards their goals. Whether you’re new to the sport of cycling, or you have much experience, I know that I offer something different than any other coaching and that is your key to reaching further and achieving your goals long and short term. .</p>
